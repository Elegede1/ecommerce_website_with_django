## Overview

The primary goal of this application is to provide a robust platform for inventory management with a user-friendly interface. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. A key feature is the real-time update mechanism, which ensures that all connected users see changes to the product inventory (like additions, updates, or deletions) instantly without needing to refresh their pages. The homepage is designed to showcase products in an e-commerce style, displaying images, names, and prices.

## Features

-   **User Authentication:**
    -   Secure user registration (Sign Up) with password confirmation.
    -   User login and logout functionality.
    -   Authenticated users have access to protected actions like product creation, updates, and deletion.
-   **Product Management (CRUD):**
    -   **Create:** Add new products with details such as name, SKU, price, quantity, supplier, and an image.
    -   **Read:**
        -   View a list of all products with key details and images.
        -   Homepage displays products in a card-based e-commerce layout.
    -   **Update:** Modify existing product information, including replacing the product image.
    -   **Delete:** Remove products from the inventory.
-   **Image Uploads:**
    -   Products can have associated images uploaded via the product form.
    -   Images are displayed on the product list and homepage.
-   **Real-time Updates (WebSockets):**
    -   Utilizes Django Channels to broadcast changes to product data (create, update, delete) to all connected clients in real-time.
    -   Provides a seamless and dynamic experience, reflecting inventory changes instantly across all user sessions.
-   **Responsive Design (with Bootstrap):**
    -   Forms and layout elements are styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface.
-   **Protected Views:**
    -   Critical actions like adding, updating, or deleting products are restricted to authenticated users. Unauthenticated users attempting to access these views are redirected to the login page.

## Technologies Used

-   **Backend:**
    -   Python 3.x
    -   Django (version used in the project, e.g., 5.x)
    -   Django Channels (for WebSocket and ASGI support)
    -   Daphne (ASGI server for development)
    -   SQLite (default development database)
    -   Pillow (for image processing and `ImageField` support)
-   **Frontend:**
    -   HTML5
    -   CSS3
    -   Bootstrap (for styling and layout)
    -   JavaScript (for client-side WebSocket handling and dynamic UI updates)
-   **Development & Version Control:**
    -   Git & GitHub (assumed for version control)
    -   Virtual Environments (e.g., `venv`)

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/invProject.git
   cd invProject
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # if you do not have pipenv
   pip install --user pipenv
   ```

3. Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```sh
   # if you have pipenv
   cd /path/to/your/invproject
   # then type
   pipenv shell
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Running the Application

Once the development server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

### User Accounts

The application provides user registration and login functionality. Once a user is registered, they can log in to access protected views like product creation, updates, and deletion.

### Product Management

The application provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing product inventory. Users can create new products, view a list of all products, and update or delete existing products.

### Admin Panel

The application includes an admin panel for managing user accounts and product inventory. Admins can view a list of all users, view and modify user details, and view and modify product details.

## Real-time Streaming with WebSockets

The application uses Django Channels to provide real-time updates to product inventory. When a user creates, updates, or deletes a product, the change is broadcasted to all connected clients in real-time. This provides a seamless and dynamic experience, reflecting inventory changes instantly across all user sessions.
